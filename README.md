# Environment GPT

## What it is
With so much access to information nowadays, it's easy to get lost or overwhelmed. We wanted to streamline and personalize climate communication by helping you answer a simple question: **How will climate change affect me?** 
That's why we created Environment GPT, a quick and easy way to see which of your favorite things will be irreversibly impacted by the climate crisis, powered by GPT-4.
